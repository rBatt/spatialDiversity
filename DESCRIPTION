Description: This package contains the data, statistical analysis, and
    figures used in the production of a manuscript about the spatial patterns of
    biodiversity change in 9 marine regions. Here I consider "biodiversity" to be
    species richness; specifically, regional species richness. Each of the nine
    regions contains many sites (between 20 and 200, e.g.). Previously, I've found
    that over the long-term (20-40 yrs), species richness is increasing or ~net
    stable in these regions. Changes in species richness are due to colonizations
    and extinctions. To better understand these documented changes in richness,
    this package/ paper looks at where these colonization/ extinction events occur.
    Species tend to be geographically rare (occupying few sites within a region)
    just after they colonize, or just before they go extinct. Therefore, for any one
    (col/ext) event, few sites are involved. However, if we look at the locations of
    these events over time and across species, are the events randomly distributed
    through space, or do they cluster? Does the location where a species went
    extinct tend to be near or far from the site where it first colonized? These
    analyses answer those questions.
